# F1-Pit-Stop-Strategy-Recommender
Our DATA602 final project aims to build a data-driven pit stop strategy recommender system. Given race conditions (driver pace, track type, weather conditions, and competitor context), the model will recommend: The optimal number of pit stops (1-stop vs 2-stop, etc.),  laps to pit on, the expected performance impact (finishing position gain/loss).
